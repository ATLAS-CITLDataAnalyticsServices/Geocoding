# Geocoding
Most replicable examples of geocoding found on-line work on a single address only. This code will hopefully help you to geocode any data frame that include addresses as a variable. In this example, I am geocoding addresses in Lima, the capital city of Peru. I use R and the package ggmap(). 
The data for this examples comes from the National Directory of Medicines, Drugs and Pharmaceutical Inputs of Peru (DIGEMID in spanish). It consist on all the registered pharmacies in Lima, Peru.
This code is an adaptation of the code provided by Shane Lynn.
