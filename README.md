# Geocoding
Most replicable examples of geocoding found on-line work on a single address only. This code will hopefully help you to geocode any data frame that include addresses as a variable. In this example, I am geocoding addresses in Lima, the capital city of Peru using R and the package ggmap(). 
The data for this examples comes from the National Directory of Medicines, Drugs and Pharmaceutical Inputs of Peru (DIGEMID in spanish). It consist on a selected sample of the registered pharmacies in Lima, Peru.
