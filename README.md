# GeocodingInLima
Geocoding addresses in Lima using R and ggmap(). 
The data for this examples comes from DIGEMID (National Directory of Medicines, Drugs and Pharmaceutical Inputs of Peru), and consists on all the registered pharmacies in Lima, Peru.
Most replicable examples of geocoding found on-line work on a single address only. This example, originally provided by Shane Lynn but simplified for addresses in Lima, makes the geocoding avalable for a list of addresses using the Geoogle server.
