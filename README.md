# Geocoding
This code will hopefully help you to geocode any data frame that include addresses as a variable. In this example, I am geocoding addresses in Lima, the capital city of Peru. I use R and the package ggmap(). 
The data for this examples comes from the National Directory of Medicines, Drugs and Pharmaceutical Inputs of Peru (DIGEMID in spanish). It consist on all the registered pharmacies in Lima, Peru.
Most replicable examples of geocoding found on-line work on a single address only. This example, originally provided by Shane Lynn, makes the geocoding available for a list of addresses using the Geoogle server.
